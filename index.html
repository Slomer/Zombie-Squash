        <ul>
          <li><strong>movement:</strong> ASWD, arrow keys, numpad
            4,5/2,6,8</li>
          <li><strong>jump:</strong> space, numpad 0</li>
          <li><strong>attack:</strong> F, control, enter, numpad +</li>
          <li><strong>attack:</strong> F, control, numpad +</li>
          <li><strong>pause:</strong> P, pause/break, pause button at
            top right</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <li>movement keys can be held or tapped.  Either works fine.</li>
        <li>You can damage enemies by jumping on their head.  You can also
         attack them, but your attack has a delay.</li>
        <li>Zombie kills will be counted at the top left, along with your
            current level</li>
        <li>Some zombies just wander around, but most will charge you.</li>
        <li>As your level goes up, so does the game difficulty.  Zombies will
            be faster, more numerous, and you will be invincible less time
            after being hurt.</li>
        <li>Your health shows at the bottom left of the game area</li>
        <li>An exclamation point above you means you took damage and are
            temporarily invulnerable.</li>
        <li>There is a pause button at the top right, which will also reshow
            these instructions.</li>
        <li>The game will also pause any time the game window loses focus.</li>
        <li>The level is procedurally generated, so reload if you don't
            like yours.</li>
        <li>You can walk through the left/right side of the screen but not
            the top/bottom.</li>
        <li>No actual reset is built into the game yet, so reload the page
            when you 'die' for now.  (or cheat by unpausing)</li>
